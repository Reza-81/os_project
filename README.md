# Operating System Project (CPU Scheduling algorithms)

## In this project, CPU scheduling algorithms are implemented with Python

to run the program you need to create a csv file as input. Like **test.csv** file.

these algorithms are:

* [FCFS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-fcfs-cpu-scheduling-set-1/)

* [MLFQ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multilevel-feedback-queue-scheduling-mlfq-cpu-scheduling/)

* [RR](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-round-robin-scheduling-for-the-same-arrival-time/)

* [SPN](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-shortest-job-first-or-sjf-cpu-scheduling-set-1-non-preemptive/)

* [SRTF](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-shortest-remaining-time-first-srtf-algorithm/)
